    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>Agriculture is one of the major sectors of the Indian economy.<b>"Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian Economy"</b>- said Mahatma Gandhi six decades ago. Even today, the situation is still the same, with almost the entire economy being sustained by agriculture, which is the mainstay of the villages.It is present in the country for thousands of years. Over the years it has developed and the use of new technologies and equipment replaced almost all the traditional methods of farming. Besides, in India, there are still some small farmers that use the old traditional methods of agriculture because they lack the resources to use modern methods. Furthermore, this is the only sector that contributed to the growth of not only itself but also of the other sector of the country.</p>
    <p>The Department of Agriculture,Government of Goa came up with a project to build a B2B platform for farmers and traders of Goa to decrease the role of the middlemen and to increase farmers income.They want millennials ideas for the technology integration and improvement of livelihood of the farmers.Consultation with the nodal officer of DoA,Goa helped us to increase our knowledge by the fact that Goa is the richest state of india and production cost for farmers there is very high compared to other parts of the country.They want us to start a ‘Pilot Project’ to implement government's new policies.Here,we are group of Bits Pilani University students helping them in their initiative.</p>
